  "nju_desc2": "This method predicts the future activity status of open source projects based on OSS Compass metrics. The method uses a feature-based time series classification prediction method by extracting statistical features from the OSS Compass metric sequence. It trains and applies machine learning intelligent classification models to predict the future active/inactive status of projects and provides approximate probability estimates. Cross-validation results on nearly 600 project datasets show an accuracy rate close to 90% for this method. In terms of generalization ability, this method can still achieve an accuracy rate of 80% on a dataset of over ten thousand repositories, demonstrating its preliminary practicality. The analysis results can partially reflect the future health status of open source projects and demonstrate the effectiveness of the OSS Compass metric system in measuring the health of open source software. This method is expected to provide valuable reference information for users, developers, investors, and managers of open source software.",

  "nju2_desc": "Introduction: In this study, we study the community evolution behavior in developer social networks around open source software projects, in response to the limitation of traditional community evolution analysis techniques being biased towards qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. We propose a set of community split, shrink, merge, and expand indices based on information entropy to measure the evolutionary behavior of open source developer social networks. Empirical studies demonstrate that these indices effectively characterize the evolution of open source communities, by achieving a 94.1% accuracy in drawing conclusions consistent with existing qualitative work through simple rules. Furthermore, additional research indicates a significant correlation between the proposed community evolution indices and the productivity of open source projects, represented by the number of commits. The information entropy-based measurement indices presented in this study provide quantitative support for understanding and analyzing the evolutionary behavior of open source communities.

  "nju3_desc": "Introduction: This research focuses on project forks on open-source software (OSS) platforms, revolving around measuring and understanding the diversity of forks in open-source software projects. The paper accomplishes this by constructing a novel fork entropy based on Rao's second entropy and assessing this diversity based on modifications to project files. Empirical studies indicate a significant correlation between fork entropy in open-source projects and various key outcomes, including external productivity of the project (measured by the number of contributions from external contributors), acceptance rate of external contributors' pull requests, and the reported number of bugs. Additionally, we observe significant interactions between fork entropy and other factors, such as the quantity of forks. These findings suggest that fork entropy, as an effective metric, not only enhances the current available measurements of forks in open-source software projects but also deepens our understanding of the development process based on forked repositories. It holds the potential to support further research and applications. Reference article:",

  "pku1_desc1": "Introduction: On the GitHub platform, many projects use the 'good first issue' (GFI) labeling mechanism to mark problems suitable for beginners, guiding them to make their first contributions to the project by addressing these introductory tasks. Tan et al.'s research found that the popularity of this mechanism is gradually increasing. However, in most projects, the proportion of issues marked as GFI is relatively low. What is even more concerning is that the resolution rate of GFI issues is not optimistic. Among all GFI issues, only about 60% are successfully solved by beginners, and a large number of GFI issues remain unresolved. On platforms like GitHub, each issue contains not only a title and description but also diverse features such as labels and comments. Therefore, Xiao et al. proposed an automatic labeling method for beginner tasks based on multiple task features. Using an XGBoost classifier, they classify issues solved by beginners from other issues at two time points: when the issue is opened and when it is resolved.",

  "pku2_desc1": "Introduction: With the rise of open source software (OSS) and the development of software package hosting platform, more and more developers choose to reuse existing third-party libraries for project development, so as to reduce development costs and improve development efficiency. However, in the process of reusing third-party libraries, when developers cannot solve the problems existing in the library through promotion and degradation, such as security vulnerabilities, compatibility, etc., they need to replace it with another third-party library with the same or similar functions, this operation is called library migration. However, due to the limited information available, developers often choose alternative libraries based on subjective opinions. By analyzing the historical development activities and ranking the library migration using multiple indicators, we can recommend the most suitable library migration scheme. Firstly, the migration history is mined from a large number of software warehouses, and the migration knowledge base is constructed. Given a library that needs to be migrated, select the candidate target libraries and then rank them by combining relevant metrics that capture evidence from different dimensions of development history: rule support, cause support, distance support, and API support; Through intelligent analysis of a large number of GitHub repositories, it is possible to recommend the target of outbound migration.",

  "pku3_desc1": "Introduction: When developers face a large number of similar licenses and complex legal terms, the problem of how to choose the right open source license for their projects arises. Xu et al. proposed LicenseRec, an open source software license recommendation tool, aiming to help users select licenses that meet their preferences based on compliance with third-party component licenses, open source style, business requirements, and community development. To achieve this goal, a knowledge base was built, which includes common license terms, compatibility information, and license selection guidelines. The workflow involves scanning the licenses of third-party components, checking license compatibility, and characterizing user preferences through user interaction. Then, based on this information, the tool recommends the most suitable license. This tool can scan and check the licenses of third-party components for compatibility and also characterize user preferences to recommend licenses that best meet their needs.",
