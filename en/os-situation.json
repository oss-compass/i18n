It is defined as the amount of code contributed by developers from one country or region to open source projects in other countries or regions, i.e., \"export\", and the amount of code contributed by developers from other countries or regions to open source projects in that country or region, i.e., \"import\". The code amount here refers to the actual amount of code written by developers in open source projects, usually measured by the number of commits and lines of code."
