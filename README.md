# OSS Compass i18n Repository

Welcome to the OSS Compass i18n Repository! 

This repository is dedicated to the translation and localization of our community projects into multiple languages. 

By contributing translations, you help make our projects accessible and usable to a wider audience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the target language.
- Git installed on your local machine.


### How to Contribute
Choose a language

Browse the locales directory to see which languages are currently supported.
If the language you want to contribute to is not listed, consider adding it. Refer to the section below on how to add a new language.
Start Translating

Locate the language file (e.g., en.json) in the appropriate locales subdirectory.
Open the language file using a text editor or the translation tool mentioned in the installation steps.
Translate the strings from English (or the source language) into the target language.
Keep the JSON structure intact while translating and avoid modifying any key names.

### Submitting Translations

Once you have completed the translation for a language or made significant progress, commit the changes to your forked repository.
Push the changes to your forked repository.
Open a pull request (PR) from your repository to the main Community i18n Repository.
Include a clear description of the changes made and the language being added or modified.
Our team will review your contribution and merge it into the main repository.

### Update Existing Translations

If you notice any outdated or incorrect translations in the existing language files, feel free to update them.
Follow the same process mentioned above for contributing translations.
Be sure to provide clear explanations and context for your changes in the pull request.

### Contact
If you have any questions or need assistance with the translation process, feel free to reach out to [OSS Compass](https://github.com/oss-compass) via [slack](https://oss-compass.org/docs/community/slack/).

Thank you for your contributions! Together, we can make our projects more accessible to people around the world.
